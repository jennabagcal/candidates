# TaxingYourVote
<h3>By: Shane English, Setrige Crawford and Jenna Bagcal</h3>

<h3>Process/problems</h3>

<p>Our project is called "Taxing Your Vote," and it includes an interactive calculator plus descriptions. To use the calculator, individuals input their yearly salary and see which of the five main presidential candidates would be the "best" for them based on their tax proposals.</p>

<p>The tabs were created by finding and customizing a code from bootstrap.com. We created one tab each for Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders, Donald Trump, Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz. We pasted the code into Sublime and input a summary of each candidate's tax proposals from the Tax Policy Center website. These summaries included the main points and some pros and cons of each proposal.</p>  

<p>A challenge we faced was combing through each of the candidate's extensive tax proposals and choosing which details to include. Creating the tabs from scratch was also a challenge, since we haven't learned the coding for that in class. We tried a few codes that were intially not responsive, until we found the bootstrap code that worked. We used that code as a skeleton for our own tabs.</p>

<p>Another challenge was trying to input links that would open in a new page instead of on the same page. This can be accomplished by adding target="_blank" next to the web address.</p>
